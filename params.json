{"name":"xbps","tagline":"The X Binary Package System","body":"## XBPS\r\n\r\nThe X Binary Package System (in short XBPS) is a new binary package system **designed and implemented from scratch**. Its goal is to be fast, easy to use, bug-free, featureful and portable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe XBPS code is totally **compatible with POSIX/SUSv2/C99 standards**, and released with a **Simplified BSD license (2 clause)**. There is a well documented API provided by the XBPS Library that is the basis for its frontends to handle binary packages and repositories. Some highlights:\r\n\r\n * Supports **multiple local and remote repositories** (FTP/HTTP/HTTPS).\r\n * **SHA256 hashes** for package metadata, files and binary packages.\r\n * Supports **package states** (ala dpkg) to mitigate broken package installs/updates.\r\n * Ability to **resume** partial package install/updates.\r\n * Ability to **unpack only files that have been modified** in package updates.\r\n * Ability to use **virtual packages**.\r\n * Ability to **replace packages**.\r\n * Ability to **put packages on hold** (to never update them. NEW in 0.16).\r\n * Ability to **preserve/update configuration files**.\r\n * Ability to **force reinstallation** of any installed package.\r\n * Ability to **downgrade any** installed package.\r\n * Ability to **execute pre/post install/remove/update scriptlets**.\r\n * Ability to **check package integrity**: missing files, hashes, missing or unresolved (reverse)dependencies, dangling or modified symlinks, etc.\r\n * **Low memory** footprint.\r\n * **Fast** dependency resolver and sorting algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe latest stable version **0.25** was released on **July 5th, 2013**.\r\n\r\n### Build requirements\r\n\r\nTo build this you'll need:\r\n\r\n  - [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)\r\n  - [pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)\r\n  - [zlib](http://www.zlib.net)\r\n  - [openssl](http://www.openssl.org)\r\n  - [libarchive >= 3.0.2](http://www.libarchive.org)\r\n  - [confuse >= 2.7](http://www.nongnu.org/confuse)\r\n\r\nand optionally:\r\n\r\n  - [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) and [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) (--with-api-docs) to build API documentation.\r\n  - [atf >= 0.15](http://code.google.com/p/kyua) (--with-tests) to build the Kyua test suite [2].\r\n\r\n### Build instructions\r\n\r\nStandard configure script (not generated by GNU autoconf).\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --prefix=/blah\r\nmake -jX\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default PREFIX is set `/usr/local` and may be changed by setting `--prefix` in the\r\n`configure` script. The `DESTDIR` variable is also supported at the install stage.\r\n\r\nThere are some more options that can be tweaked, see them with\r\n`./configure --help'.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
